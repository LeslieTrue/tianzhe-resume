Hi, I'm Tianzhe Chu. I'm a junior undergraduate student major in Computer Science at ShanghaiTech University. I'm now a visiting student at University of California, Berkeley. I am currently an undergraduate researcher in Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Lab(BAIR) advised by Prof. Yi Ma. I'm interested in unsupervised learning, generative models and neural rendering. Besides, I'm broadly interested in classical music.
